How to use v-if/v-else/v-show and v-for to read the data and interact with DOM

Difference between v-if and v-show

+ v-if detach the element from DOM. We don't see the element in the DOM (using inspect to see check)
+ v-show doesn't detach DOM, just change Style, Display property will be assigned a value "none". v-show cannot commbine with v-else


v-for: Using value, key and index to traverse the array or object
